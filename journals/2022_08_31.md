- ### why do we need interpreted programming language while we have a compiled language?
	- **To achieve platform independence:** Compiled languages must be compiled to the specific architecture the program will execute on. If one is allowed to assume that there will always be an interpreter present for your language on the target machine, then all programs may be written in a *common format *that all interpreters of that language understand. One doesn’t need to a compile separate executable for each kind of machine the program runs on.
	- **To speed up development and testing:** It’s much easier to write a few lines of bash or python scripts and test it rather than writing it in C and having to compile it every time. Compiled languages generally have the advantage that they execute *faster. *However, there’s only so much speed that you need for a lot of real-world applications and ease of writing/testing/debugging often wins the day.
