- Everest Group defines **Intelligent Document Processing (IDP)** as any software product or solution that uses AI technologies such as **computer vision**, **OCR**, **Natural Language Processing(NLP)**, and **machine/deep learning** to **capture**, **categorize**, and **extract** data from documents (e.g., email, text, PDF, and scanned documents) for further processing. These solutions are typically **non-invasive** and can be integrated with internal applications, systems, and other automation platforms.
- IDP products find a wide variety of use cases from different business functions and verticals. The adoption of IDP solutions can not only help enterprises achieve **cost savings**, but also improve their **workforce productivity** and employee & customer **experience**. These products are also rapidly evolving in the sophistication of their **capabilities**, **features**, and **functionalities** and IDP technology providers are increasingly offering a **low-code/no-code** platform to enable citizen developers to configure the platform without the need for data scientists.
- In this study, we assess IDP software products that leverage AI/cognitive capabilities and are available for independent licensing. They are offered either as platforms that allow enterprises to **deploy out-of-the-box solutions using pre-built modules** or as custom solutions to buyers with the intent of **classifying and extracting data from documents**.
